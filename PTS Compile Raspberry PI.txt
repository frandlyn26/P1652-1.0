Raspberry Pi node compile
Test run 
user adjustments maybe required. This is not for the faint of heart.


1. Best to create a user that has SUDO capability instead of using root
   1. From a terminal (<CNTRL>+<SHIFT>+t) if not already in one.
   2. Useradd “ place a username you want to use here and erase quotes”
   3. Usermod -aG sudo “username from previous step”
      1. Choose password and follow prompts, password only thing required
2. Switch to your user
   1. su User
   2. If you are in root directory, then  “cd ..” and run dir command until you see other choices such as home
   3. cd home (or whater directory you choose) I recommend home or one with your username if present
3. From your chosen directory
   1. mkdir P1652
   2. cd P1652
4. Get dependencies
   1. sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
   2. sudo apt-get install git build-essential cmake make libuv1-dev libmicrohttpd-dev gcc g++ automake autoconf pkg-config libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev libssl-dev libgmp-dev
   3. sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
   4. Git clone https://github.com/frandlyn26/P1652-1.0.git
5. Create Build folder
   1. Mkdir build
   2. Cd build
6. Compile - 
   1. cmake .. -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-mcpu=cortex-a72 -mtune=cortex-a72" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-mcpu=cortex-a72 -mtune=cortex-a72"
   2. Make
